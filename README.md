# Sarah Goodwin

Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development

Proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Django and PostgreSQL.

Currently working as an Event Tech Project Manager where I build apps and website platforms using the CrowdComms CMS, helping clients to achieve the look, feel and flow of their website and app, ensuring a smooth running of the tech at their event. I enjoy putting peoples ideas and wants into practice, and creating a platform that enhances the user experience.

Prior to this I have 14 years experience in Customer Service, working in a variety of industries such as hospitality, tourism and corporate. I am a valuable team-player with strong communication skills and effective problem solving ability.
